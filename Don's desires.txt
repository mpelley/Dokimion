Don would like to be able to transfer a whole project from/to:
* Server to server
* Server to local file system
* Local file system to server

Cloner could do the above by:
* Adding "local file system" as a source or target (not both).  [Define an interface used by Form with two implementing classes behind the interface, one for server, one for file system.]
* Adding project data to what is stored on the local file system.

Don would like test case authors to work in GitHub and then upload the new test case to Dokimion.

Don would like to be able to restore a corrupted or deleted test case from the local file system (GitHub cloned repo).
